# data/ Folder

## Overview
This folder contains all data-related files for the FundPulse project, organized into **raw** (original, unmodified) and **processed** (cleaned, ready for analysis) subfolders.

## Subfolders

### `raw/`
**Purpose**: Store original, unmodified source data as received

- Never edit or overwrite files in this folder
- Document the source, date received, and any format notes
- Include README.md describing data sources
- Example: `donations_2024.csv`, `donor_metadata.xlsx`

### `processed/`
**Purpose**: Store cleaned, transformed data ready for analysis

- Generated by running cleaning scripts/notebooks
- Always regenerable from `raw/` data (reproducibility principle)
- Document all transformations applied
- Include README.md explaining processing steps
- Example: `donations_cleaned.csv`, `donors_deduplicated.csv`

## Best Practices

✅ **DO**:
- Keep `raw/` untouched—treat it as read-only
- Document data source, format, and date in README
- Regenerate `processed/` from `raw/` if needed
- Use descriptive file names with dates
- Include data dictionaries in each subfolder

❌ **DON'T**:
- Manually edit raw data files
- Store intermediate files here (use outputs/ instead)
- Create deeply nested subfolders within data/
- Mix raw and processed data
- Store code scripts in data/ (use src/ instead)

## File Naming Convention

```
{project}_{description}_{date}.{ext}
```

Examples:
- `donations_raw_2024-01.csv`
- `donors_cleaned_2024-01.csv`
- `campaign_summary_processed.xlsx`
